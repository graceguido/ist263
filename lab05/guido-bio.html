        <p>Regarding public relations, I have always been interested in studying communications and writing/public speaking has always been something that has come naturally to me. With my iSchool major, I became interested in technology after taking an iSchool intro class my freshman year. I am interested in programming and web development.</p> 
        
        
        <p>One of my accomplishments is working at the student-run PR firm on campus and being an account supervisor. Another is being on the deanâ€™s list all semesters.</p>
