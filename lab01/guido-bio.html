        My name is Grace Guido. I am currently a dual-major studying both public relations and innovation, society, and technology. Regarding public relations, I have always been interested in studying communications and writing/public speaking has always been something that has come naturally to me. With my iSchool major, I became interested in technology after taking an iSchool intro class my freshman year. I am interested in programming and web development. One of my accomplishments is working at the student-run PR firm on campus and being an account supervisor. Another is being on the deanâ€™s list all semesters. Outside of work, I am really interested in makeup. I also love lifting and anything health/fitness related. In my spare time I like to read and write as well. One unique aspect about me is that I am a vegetarian.
