        <h4>Dead Prom Queen</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 7/10</p>
        <img src="../images/lookbookdeadpromqueen.jpg" alt="Dead Proom Queen">
        <p>I did this look for a Halloween party that was themed “Haunted Wedding.” Obviously, I decided to go as a dead prom queen. Take this look to the next level by using fake blood. Drip the fake blood around your face and neck. Contour your chest with the dark grey and use more purple eyeshadow to create more bruises. For this look, I used my regular base (primer, foundation, concealer) and then contoured my face using a dark gray color to hollow out my cheekbones and forehead. After I contoured, I used a dark purple eyeshadow to create the appearance of bruises under my eyes and around my face. For my eyeshadow, I used a dark purple and gray to create an intense smoking eye, and then popped a shimmery highlight on the inner corner. Of course, this look was completed with fake lashes and a deep purple lipstick. To take this look to the next level, use fake blood to drip around your face/neck. Also, contour your chest and use the purple eyeshadow all over your body to give the appearance of bruises. With this dead-prom queen inspired look, you are sure to be the prettiest girl in the cemetery. </p>

        <h4>Grungy, Green Smokey Eye</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 6.5/10</p>
        <p>This look was perfect for Juice Jam. I paired the green smoky eye with an army-print mini skirt and a cutout black top that fit the grunge vibe perfectly. For this look, I did my normal base consisting of primer, foundation, concealer, and stick contour. Once I had my base set, I used setting powder, contour and blush. For looks where you want your contour to stand out and look really chiseled, baking your face with setting powder is the way to go. Additionally, if you want to achieve a good nose contour, I recommend baking the sides of your nose with powder to make that nose contour really stand out. For my eyeshadow I used the Jeffree Star X Shane Dawson Conspiracy palette. For my crease, I used the shades “Tanacon” and “Diet Root Beer.” For the eyelid, I recommend doing a cut-crease to make the look more dramatic. Once I cut my crease using concealer, I used the shade “Conspiracy” on the eyelid.  Finally, I blended black into the outer corner to make the look darker and a little more intense. For my inner corner highlight, I used a shimmery light-gold to compliment the green. Finally, I used false lashes to bring the whole thing together. </p>

        <h4>Natural Glow</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 4/10</p>
        <p>This look is everyday and wearable, a staple that works whether you are going to class or out to dinner with your friends. For this look, I used powder foundation instead of liquid foundation. Currently, I like using the Ulta Beauty Mineral Powder Foundation. Before applying the powder foundation, I recommend using a skin-tone shade concealer to conceal under your eyes and any areas where you would like a bit more coverage. Set the concealer with the powder foundation and apply it all over your face using a foundation brush. Next, I used the Hoola Caramel bronzer by Benefit to add warmth to my face. Next, I applied a pink blush and a pearlescent highlighter. For the eyes, I simply applied a warm brown shade in my crease and then used a shimmery, light-pink shade all over my eyelid (the shade Marzipan in the Too Faced Chocolate Bar palette is perfect for this!) Finally, I smudged some black eyeshadow along my lash line to make it a little more intense and repeated this step on my waterline. For looks like this, simplicity is key. Use lighter-coverage products then you are used to and focus on making your skin look gorgeous and glowing. </p>

        <h4>Dinner Date</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 6/10</p>
        <p>Dinner Date: This look is the perfect look for a hot dinner date or having a night out on the town with your friends. What’s better than a red statement lipstick? I have no idea. For this look I used my regular base makeup and made my contour stand out by baking with setting powder. For my eyeshadow, I kept it quite simple with the cool-toned brown shade “Twig” from the Anastasia Beverly Hills “Sultry” palette. This was a matte eye look, so I used the shade “Fresh” from the Sultry palette all over my eyelid. Although it is quite a simple eye look, it pairs perfectly with red lipstick and winged black eyeliner. </p>

        <h4>Red All Over</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 7/10</p>
        <p>This is one of my favorite looks of all-time. This was a creation of boredom and no, I did not go anywhere after doing this despite it taking two hours. For this look, I used my normal base makeup application. I also really focused in on doing my nose contour which sometimes I skip out on. The real star of this look is the black and red winged eyeliner. I covered my eyelids with skin tone concealer and set it with powder. That's the only eyeshadow I used. Next, I went in with a liquid, black eyeliner and created a dramatic wing but only took the black eyeliner about halfway down my lash line. From the inner corner of my lash line to where the black eyeliner began, I used red eyeliner. Where the red and black liner meet up, its important to blend them together so it is cohesive.  I used a very bright and sparkly white eyeshadow for my inner corner since the rest of the look was matte. On my waterline, I smudged black eyeshadow and then blended red eyeshadow all around the under-eye area. This tied the whole look together. Finally, I finished the look with some fake lashes and a dramatic red lip. This look has just enough red to make a statement but not too much either. </p>

        <h4>Totally Enchanted</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 8/10</p>
        <p>Totally Enchanted: This makeup look was for Halloween last year when I dressed up as a fairy. One of my more creative looks, the face makeup took a different approach than usual. I applied my foundation and concealer as usual but went in with a purple/pink shade for my contour. Using purple for the contour gave the look an ethereal vibe and totally achieved the whimsicalness that I was going for. In addition to the contour, I used a blue eyeliner to create swirls on my forehead. Finally, I used the NYX “face and body glitter brillants” in the shade “violet” as highlighter on my cheekbones. For my eyeshadow, I used a deep purple in my crease and then I cut the crease to create a dramatic look. I used a white eyeshadow on the entirety of my eyelid. Then, I did winged liner using the same blue color as I used on my face. Under my eyes, I blended a light blue shade that matched the eyeliner. I took this blending down way lower than I usually would to make my face more colorful and to highlight the blue color a little bit more. Looks like this you get to have fun with, make it your own!</p>

        <h4>Goth Babe</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 8/10</p>
        <p>This look was a fun project for me, but totally not something I would wear out on the regular. However, if this is the aesthetic you are going for, this look has you covered. To start off, I did my normal base. For the eyelids, this was an extremely frustrating process that took about an hour on its own during which I almost gave up. To start off, I blended a deep purple into my crease. This look is a halo-eye, meaning that the center of the eyelid is going to be lighter than the inner and outer corners of the eye. To achieve that look I carefully blended black into my crease and around my inner and outer corner. Once I had packed on a good amount of black, I used concealer to give the center of the eye a blank slate to apply the red shade. For this look, blending is key! Also, making sure to give your eyeshadow lots of love and build the colors up to make them stand out. For my lash line, I kept it simple and smudged the purple I used on my eyelid crease underneath my eye. To complete the look, I drew a heart under my eye with black eyeliner and used a shimmery pink lip gloss. When you are doing statement looks with your eyes such as these, I prefer to use a less intense lip shade, so the different elements of your face aren't competing for attention. </p>

        <h4>Colors of the Rainbow</h4>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 8.5/10</p>
        <p>We all know I’m a sucker for bright pigments a whole lot of color and this look really confirms that. For this look, I did my normal base routine. Obviously, the star of this look is the eyeshadow, and this was not a simple look to achieve. For looks such as these, it is so important to focus on blending and pigmentation. You want your colors to look bright and lively, and your blending should mix all of the different colors together with ease (AKA, no harsh lines). To start off, I blended a light pink shade all over my crease. Next, I took a deep blue shade and focused that on the inner corner of my crease. Next, I took a deeper purple shade and blended that onto the outer part of my crease, making sure to blend the purple and blue together nicely where they met. Finally, I cut-out my crease using concealer and applied a bright, shimmery blue to my eyelid. On the inner corner, I used a sparkly green shade and complimented that by blending a light green under my lash line to tie it all together. Of course, the look was finished off with fake lashes and a neutral, pink lipstick. </p>
