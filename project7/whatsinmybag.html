            <h4>Anastasia Beverly Hills Luminous Foundation</h4>
            <p>The foundation I am using right now is the Anastasia Beverly Hills Luminous Foundation. While it isn't full coverage, it is a nice medium coverage foundation with the potential for buildable coverage. What I love most about this foundation is how well it matches my skin-tone. There is a wide selection of shades to chose from, I am currently using shade 150W. I got this foundation on sale at Sephora, which was such a steal, but I will be indulging in this product again once I run out. It gives the perfect amount of coverage for glam while still looking skin-like. It is not too matte or overly dewy and works perfectly as long as I make sure to apply setting powder. It doesn't accentuate any creases or wrinkles in the skin, and when paired with a good primer can absolutely have a blurring effect. </p>

            <h4>Benefit Hoola Caramel Bronzer</h4>
            <p>The bronzer I can't get enough of is Benefit's Hoola Caramel. This bronzer is a little warmer than the regular Hoola, and not quite as dark. This makes it perfect if you really want to give a warm, summer glow (even in the middle of winter)! It is extremely pigmented (use with caution) but I can't recommend this product enough as a staple bronzer. </p>

            <h4>Tarte Shape Tape</h4>
            <p>As far as concealer goes, we all know there is one that reigns supreme. While shape tape can be used on your under-eyes, recently I have found I don't like to have to have a concealer that heavy in that spot. However, it is perfect for spot concealing and works amazingly as an eyeshadow primer. </p>

            <h4>ColourPop Pretty Fresh Hyaluronic Creamy Concealer</h4>
            <p>This concealer is my holy grail for the under eye. Like the name suggests, it is perfectly creamy and is just the right amount of coverage. It doesn't feel heavy, but it totally covers up all under eye bags (and trust me, I have a lot). I recommend getting this concealer in a shade that's 1 or 2 shades lighter than your skin tone. This way, you are brightening up your undereye area. Additionally, this concealer works nicely to reverse contour. </p>

            <h4>Anastasia Beverly Hills Shadow Contour Stick</h4>
            <p>As someone who loves contouring, cream contour is an absolute necessity. Without applying any powder, cream contour allows your cheeks to have beautiful definition. The stick form is very convenient since you do not need any additional tools to apply it. I blend this out using either a face blending brush or a beauty blender. Although I do like this product, be careful of how you apply it to avoid it looking muddy. Placement is key. </p>

            <h4>Colourpop Blush Stix</h4>
            <p>Like the cream contour, cream blush is a must have. Cream blush gives your face such a pretty but natural looking tint. I apply this directly to my face and blend it out with a beauty blender. I have this product in the shade “Mini Me” which is a perfect light pink. This product blends like a dream and is a must-have. </p>

            <h4>NT x B Pressed Pigment Palette</h4>
            <p>If you are looking for a colorful palette full of pigment, this is the one for you. The shimmery shades are to die for and are of extremely high quality. The matte shades blend nicely and are very pigmented as well. If you are someone who needs some good, colorful shimmer shades in your life this is a must-have. </p>

            <h4>Kat Von D Shade and Light Palette</h4>
            <p>This has been my holy-grail contour palette for years. With three different highlighting and contouring shades it is extremely versatile. The highlighting shades really do a great job of brightening the areas that you apply them too but be warned because they are very pigmented and can give an unwanted pink/yellow tint since they are not translucent. The contouring shades blend well and are the perfect balance of warm and cool tones. </p>
