            <p>Difficulty Rating: 7/10</p>
            <p>I did this look for a Halloween party that was themed “Haunted Wedding.” Obviously, I decided to go as a dead prom queen.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Apply your base.</strong> This includes foundation, concealer and setting powder. Feel free to use shades a little lighter than your normal skin tone to increase that "dead" look</li>
                <li><strong>Contour using a dark grey powder/eyeshadow.</strong> Using grey to contonur your cheeks and forehead instead of a deeper skin tone color will add to the "dead" appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a dark purple eyeshadow and apply generously under your eyes.</strong> The purple is used to simulate the appearance of bruises and dark circles. Blend the purple shadow anywhere you want the appearance of bruises.</li>
                <li><strong>Do your eyebrows as your normally would.</strong> I used dip brow pomade for this step.</li>
                <li><strong>Set your eyelids with eyeshadow primer</strong> to make the color really pop. I kept this eye look simple using purple and dark grey to create a deep smokey eye. Finally, I added a little bit of highlight on my inner corner.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete the look with a dark lipstick and false lashes</strong></li>
                <li>Take the look to the next step by dripping fake blood on your face/chest. Feel free to bring the grey contour and purple eyeshadow down your neck/chest to bring it to the next level!</li>
