            <h2>Dead Prom Queen</h2>
            <p>Difficulty Rating: 7/10</p>
            <br>
            <p>I did this look for a Halloween party that was themed “Haunted Wedding.” Obviously, I decided to go as a dead prom queen. </p>
            <p>Take this look to the next level by using fake blood. Drip the fake blood around your face and neck. Contour your chest with the dark grey and use more purple eyeshadow to create more bruises. For this look, I used my regular base (primer, foundation, concealer) and then contoured my face using a dark gray color to hollow out my cheekbones and forehead. After I contoured, I used a dark purple eyeshadow to create the appearance of bruises under my eyes and around my face. For my eyeshadow, I used a dark purple and gray to create an intense smoking eye, and then popped a shimmery highlight on the inner corner. Of course, this look was completed with fake lashes and a deep purple lipstick. To take this look to the next level, use fake blood to drip around your face/neck. Also, contour your chest and use the purple eyeshadow all over your body to give the appearance of bruises. With this dead-prom queen inspired look, you are sure to be the prettiest girl in the cemetery.</p>
